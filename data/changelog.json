This brings up a list of (hopefully) all available active effect attribute keys for the actor/item effect you're configuring. For those of you who use DAE, this is similar to the dropdown it provides for quickly selecting a key. As such, Plutonium's version  can be disabled in the Config for UI. [This was added mainly for my own benefit as I explore Active Effects, and may not be a permanent fixture]\n- Improved Starting Equipment/Equipment Shop UI, adding better visual hinting when gold has been rolled, and adding more navigation options\n- Improved compatibility with the Forien's Quest Log module\n- Improved Spell Importer dice parsing\n- Fixed Background Importer off-by-one error when rolling for characteristics\n- Fixed Equipment Shop failing to load its saved and/or default item list\n- Fixed Equipment Shop failing to correctly set an actor's currency on confirming a transaction\n- Fixed Package Importer list highlighting when clicking between selections\n- Fixed Item Importer splitting \"atomic\" collections of items (e.g. \"Bag of Ball Bearings (1,000)\") into their constituent items on import. If you still wish to import 1,000 individual Ball Bearing items, a Config option has been provided to disable this new behaviour.\n- Fixed Race Importer double-applying skill proficiencies in some cases \n- Added Rivet support for routePrefix'd game URLs [this update should have already been live in the Chrome and Firefox extension stores for some time]\n- (Added Rivet source to download)"

Note that this _can_ be used without the \"Enable Data Source Filtering\" Config option recommended, to forcibly select _every_ available source, although this is not recommended for performance reasons. With these options are enabled, source selection screens will be silently skipped where possible.\n- Added \"World Content Blacklist\" tool; this is a port of the 5etools Blacklist, and works similarly\n- Added \"Importer Image Preloader\" tool, which finds and downloads all images available in the current version of the site to your Config'd \"Image/Token Directory\" [this aims to be equivalent to downloading the (long-dead) images zip and manually creating an `img` from it]\n- The Import Wizard \"Open Default Importer\" buttons are now \"Open Last-Used Importer\" buttons, which will open the importer using the previous selection of sources made. If the \"Force Select All\" Data Source Config option(s) are enabled, this will instead open the importer with all sources selected.\n- (v9) Added \"Import All\" option to compendium title menu [this is the same functionality as a regular right-click -> import all]\n- Added drag-and-drop support for list items in Creature, Objects, and Vehicles Importers. Dropping a list item to the canvas imports the dropped entity, and creates a token for it at the drop point. Note that setting the \"Duplicate Handling Mode\" Importer Config option to \"Skip Duplicates\" is highly recommended when using this feature!\n- Added \"Delete Message\" context menu option to chat messages\n- Tweaked/improves various UI elements, notably adding missing red coloring for various \"delete\" buttons\n- Parallelized loading of homebrew in various source selection apps, greatly improving performance when loading many homebrew files\n- Fixed various Importers downloading item images during item pre-load step, causing _all_ item images to be downloaded\n- Fixed Spell Importer treating non-feet units as feet when applying metric conversions\n- The Level Up sheet button now prefers the most-recently-released non-UA version of a class when trying to determine the actor's classes, if no previous import data is present\n- Importer metric conversion now round to a max of 3 decimal places\n- Fixed Tidy5e Sheet \"dark\"-compatible styling being applied to non-sheet apps\n- Improved custom actor active effect error handling; more information (such as the affected actor's name/ID) is now logged, to (hopefully) assist debugging\n- (Server; v0.4.1) (v9) Added optional Electron addon, to enable popout windows when running inside the Electron app (although this is still not recommended!)"
